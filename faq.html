                            If the wound has broken your skin and you haven't had your tetanus shot in a while, you could need one. 
                            Tetanus is a dangerous but uncommon illness that, if left untreated, can be fatal. 
                            Through a skin wound or cut, the bacteria that might cause tetanus can enter your body.

                        <p>In order to handle small accidents and injuries, it's crucial to have a fully equipped first aid kit at home.  
                            A basic first aid kit may contain plasters, gauze and eye dressings, bandages, disposable sterile gloves, tweezers, scissors, alcohol-free cleansing wipes, thermometer (preferably digital), skin rash creams, painkillers and eye wash. A simple first aid manual or instruction booklet may also be helpful to keep on hand with your first aid supplies. Regular checks should be made to ensure that medications are still within their use-by dates.

They can determine whether your baby's symptoms are likely due to a cow's milk allergy or something else entirely. Before eliminating cow's milk from your child's diet since it provides vital nutrients, make sure you consult a doctor. Cowsâ€™ Milk Allergy is estimated that 7% of infants under the age of one are affected, but most kids outgrow it by the time they are five.

                        <p>Antibodies from mothers are transferred to their unborn children through the placenta during the final three months of pregnancy. Because the infant has received antibodies rather than producing them on its own, this sort of immunity is referred to as passive immunity. The mother's immunity affects the quantity and kind of antibodies passed on to the child. In newborns, immunity is only transient and begins to decline after the first few weeks or months.

                        <p>After surgery, it's normally advisable to take a shower so you can manage the water flow and if instructed to keep the incision dry, avoid getting it wet. After some operations, you can be instructed not to take a bath. This is because you shouldn't soak your wound in water until it has healed. It can soften the skin and reopen the wound.

                        <p>Every operation is unique. Depending on the operation and anaesthetic you're having, you may or may not be allowed to eat or drink anything before. Before you have your operation, the healthcare professionals treating you will tell you if you can eat or drink before, what foods and liquids you can have, if eating and drinking are allowed, when to stop eating and drinking (if eating and drinking are allowed).
